### To dos as of 5/28
- ***DONE, EXCEPT TRAINING DATA IN SNOW*** Update the training documents for Vanna, check training function, plus consider creating functions for storing training data in snowflake (need to test ChromaDB in Render disk to make decision)
- ***DONE*** Figure out Mem0 connection for each new demo, is it separate? Yes, needs an org and project ids
- ***DONE, BUT NEED TO TRAIN IT BETTER***Turn Vanna into a tool that the other assistants can call (See PRD I started using Claude)
    -- If this proves to be hard, then hack it by having the motion analyst request data, then I manually run the text to sql analyst, and then feed the results to the motion analyst
- ***DONE*** For demo, add and AI assistant selector switch in the streamlit UI (before we have an embeddings-based assistant selector)
- Ensure that Assisatn can answer the WHY of things based on data, may need to tweak system prompt


### Later
- Embeddings based AI assistant selector
- Create paper trail citation system. See PRD here that I created with Claude
