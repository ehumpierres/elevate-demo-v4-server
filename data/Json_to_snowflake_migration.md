If you're fine starting fresh without migrating existing data, that simplifies our approach considerably. Let me explain the table structure options:

### Single Table Design (Recommended)
Instead of creating a table for each user, I recommend using a single table with a user_id column as a primary key or unique identifier. This approach is:

- **More scalable**: Easier to manage as your user base grows
- **More efficient**: Snowflake handles partitioning based on user_id internally
- **Better for queries**: Allows for analytics across all users if needed

### Proposed Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_conversations (
    user_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    conversation_history VARIANT,  -- Stores the entire conversation history as JSON array
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);
```

The `VARIANT` data type in Snowflake is perfect for this use case as it can store semi-structured data like your JSON history array. You can query and manipulate this JSON directly in Snowflake.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create the table** in your Snowflake instance
2. **Create a new `SnowflakeShortTermMemory` class** that replaces the JSON file operations with Snowflake operations:
   - `_load_conversation()` becomes a SELECT query 
   - `save_conversation()` becomes an UPSERT operation
   - The rest of the interface remains the same

3. **Update the config** to remove JSON file paths and add Snowflake connection settings

This approach requires minimal changes to your existing codebase, as the `MemoryManager` can still work with the same interface, just different underlying storage.
