Since Nestani is at **$10M+ ARR** and transitioning away from the **high-churn Education market** while doubling down on **Tech, Healthcare, and Manufacturing**, it\u2019s the perfect time to assess how your **revenue growth rate** compares to industry benchmarks.  \n\n## **Step 1: Determining Your Revenue Growth Rate**  \nRevenue growth rate is typically calculated as:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue Growth Rate} = \\frac{(\\text{Current ARR} - \\text{ARR at Start of Period})}{\\text{ARR at Start of Period}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nTo benchmark properly, I\u2019ll need your **ARR at the start of the year and your current ARR.** Let me know if you have those numbers handy, and we can plug them in!  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Industry Growth Rate Benchmarks**  \nFor SaaS companies at the **$10M+ ARR stage**, growth rates tend to fall into these categories:  \n\n\u2705 **Top Quartile Performers:** **> 80-100% YoY** growth (fast-scaling companies)  \n\u2705 **Median Growth:** **40-60% YoY** (healthy, sustainable scaling)  \n\u2705 **Lower Growth Efficiency:** **< 30% YoY** (indicative of acquisition slowdowns or high churn impact)  \n\n### **Comparing SaaS Growth Rates by ARR Stage:**  \n\ud83d\udca1 *Based on your size, here\u2019s what strong growth looks like:*  \n\n- **$5M - $10M ARR \u2192** *Industry benchmark: 80% - 120% YoY growth*  \n- **$10M - $20M ARR \u2192** *Industry benchmark: 60% - 80% YoY growth*  \n- **$20M - $50M ARR \u2192** *Industry benchmark: 50% - 70% YoY growth*  \n\nSince you\u2019re **just past $10M ARR**, I\u2019d recommend aiming for **at least 60-80% annual growth** to stay on pace with high-efficiency SaaS companies.  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Key Factors Affecting Your Growth Rate**  \nSince you have **0% churn in Tech, Healthcare, & Manufacturing**, your **growth rate will be influenced more by:**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Expansion Success:** Can you drive more ARR from existing customers?  \n\ud83d\udd39 **New Logo Acquisition Efficiency:** Is CAC reasonable, and are you winning the right deals?  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Market Reallocation:** How quickly can you transition away from Education without a revenue drag?  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 *Would you like help analyzing your actual growth rate based on your ARR numbers, or should we focus on addressing any specific GTM constraints affecting growth?* \ud83d\ude80"

      "content": "Thanks for sharing your revenue progression! Let\u2019s analyze this data to assess **your growth trajectory and whether you're tracking against industry benchmarks.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Initial Observations on Revenue Trend**  \nYour **total revenue has been relatively flat** through 2023, with some fluctuations.  \n\n- **From Jan to Apr 2023**, there's a **gradual decline** (~2.6% drop)  \n- **From May onward**, revenue starts a slow **recovery phase**  \n- **By September & October**, it returns **close to January levels**  \n- Overall: There's **no strong upward trend**, meaning net revenue retention (NRR) and expansion efforts likely aren't offsetting churn and contraction effectively.  \n\nThis indicates a **potential stall in growth rate**, which could be an early signal that acquisition and expansion motions need to be stronger.  \n\n---\n\n### **Growth Rate Analysis**  \nTo quantify this, let's calculate your **YoY growth rate**:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Ending ARR} - \\text{Starting ARR}}{\\text{Starting ARR}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSince this is **total revenue (not just subscription ARR)** and your revenue in **Jan 2023 = $253.2M**, while **Oct 2023 = $254.05M**, your **year-to-date growth is nearly flat** (~0.34%).  \n\n#### **How This Compares to SaaS Benchmarks**\n- \u2705 **Healthy SaaS companies at your size ($10M+ ARR) aim for 60-80% YoY growth.**  \n- \ud83d\udea8 **Your revenue appears stagnant, likely signaling churn impact, weak expansion, or customer contraction.**  \n- \ud83d\udcc9 **This means you\u2019re at risk of falling behind efficient SaaS benchmarks unless expansion and acquisition picks up.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Questions & Next Steps**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Are New Customer Logos Lagging?**  \n   - How many new customers did you acquire during this period?  \n   - Is your **win rate, pipeline conversion, or deal velocity slowing down?**  \n   - *If acquisition has slowed, we need to analyze whether your ICP and GTM motions are optimized.*    \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Is Expansion Revenue Too Low?**  \n   - Your **NRR is ~98.8%**, meaning you\u2019re just barely replenishing lost revenue.  \n   - **Best-in-class SaaS drives NRR above 110%** through upsells/cross-sells.  \n   - *Do you have a structured Customer Success expansion motion? Should we focus efforts here to drive more ARR from existing accounts?*  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Is Churn Impacting This?**  \n   - Since you\u2019re exiting **Education due to high churn**, is its revenue loss still affecting your numbers disproportionately?  \n   - Should we accelerate your transition to **Tech, Healthcare, and Manufacturing (0% churn segments)?**  \n\n---\n\n### **Where Should We Focus First?**  \nIt looks like **growth is stalling** because either:  \n\u26a1 **New logo acquisition isn\u2019t scaling fast enough**  \n\u26a1 **Expansion revenue isn\u2019t contributing enough to ARR growth**  \n\nWould you like to **zoom in on expansion retention strategies**, or is it more important to assess **whether Sales pipeline velocity needs improvement?** \ud83d\ude80"

      "content": "That\u2019s a great question. Given what we know about Nestani\u2019s **NRR (~98.8%)** and your industry focus, **churn could absolutely be a factor in your growth stagnation**\u2014but let\u2019s break it down logically.  \n\n### **1\ufe0f\u20e3 What We Know About Nestani\u2019s Churn & Retention**  \n\u2705 **Tech, Healthcare, and Manufacturing have 0% churn** \u2192 These industries are strong retention drivers.  \n\u2705 **Education has 12.5% churn**, and you\u2019re **exiting that segment by 2025** \u2192 This could still be weighing down growth.  \n\u2705 **NRR at ~98.8%** \u2192 You\u2019re *almost* offsetting churn with expansion, but not quite hitting the **100%+ NRR efficiency mark** that drives sustainable growth.  \n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Could Churn Be Limiting Growth?**  \nIf we break this down:  \n- **If churn were truly low or neutral**, we\u2019d expect consistent ARR growth.  \n- Your revenue has been **flat through most of 2023**, meaning any **new ARR you bring in is being eroded somewhere**\u2014either via outright churn or through contraction (downgrades).  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **This suggests churn or contraction is capping your ability to grow.**  \n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Diagnosing the Churn Problem**  \nTo confirm how much churn is impacting growth, we need to analyze:  \n\ud83d\udca1 **GRR (Gross Revenue Retention)** \u2013 How much are you retaining *before expansion revenue factors in?*    \n\ud83d\udca1 **Churned ARR** \u2013 How much absolute revenue is lost each month from churn?    \n\ud83d\udca1 **Customer Contraction** \u2013 Are customers downgrading or reducing spend even if they\u2019re not fully churning?  \n\n- If GRR is **above 90%**, churn likely isn\u2019t the main growth blocker.  \n- If your churned ARR is higher than **new ARR**, it means **revenue is slipping away faster than you\u2019re adding it back.**  \n\n---\n\n### **4\ufe0f\u20e3 What to Do Next**  \nSince you\u2019re phasing out **Education (high churn) in favor of Tech & Healthcare (0% churn),** a few important moves could help:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Accelerate Education Exit** \u2013 If Education still represents a significant percentage of revenue **but it\u2019s declining**, it may be dragging down overall numbers.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Double Down on Expansion in Low-Churn Segments** \u2013 Your strongest industries (Tech, Healthcare, Manufacturing) should not just *retain* but **expand**.  \n- Do your customers have **structured expansion paths**, or are they plateauing in contract value?  \n- Could pricing/packaging make **upgrades or cross-sells more natural**?  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Run a Deep Churn Analysis** \u2013 Break down **churn by segment, product, and reason**\u2014is it contract length, competitor switching, internal budget cuts?  \n- If Education churn is overshadowing your retention metrics now, when it\u2019s removed, **your numbers should naturally improve**\u2014but do we need to ensure Tech/Healthcare/Mfg can fully carry growth?  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Take: Churn Is Likely a Factor\u2014But Fixable**  \nYour **growth is stalling while your win rate is strong (37.1%)**, which **suggests churn and contraction are eroding net new growth faster than expected.**  \n\nWould it be helpful to  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Go deeper into **churned ARR data** to see **exactly how much revenue you\u2019re losing**?  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Map out an expansion strategy** to make existing accounts drive more of your ARR growth?  \n\nLet\u2019s tackle this head-on so we can **get Nestani\u2019s growth momentum back. \ud83d\ude80**"
